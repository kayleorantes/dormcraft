# Frontend Design Updates - Ocean Theme

## Overview
Major UI/UX overhaul implementing an "ocean-water-luminara" design theme across the entire application.

## Key Changes

### 1. Visual Theme Updates
- **Color Palette**: Changed from purple/blue gradients to ocean-inspired colors (`#4a8bb8` background, `#1db2eb` accents)
- **Fonts**: Implemented Google Fonts ('Fredoka', 'Kalam') for a more playful, flowy aesthetic
- **Typography**: All text on ocean background is white for optimal readability
- **Consistent Background**: All pages now use solid `#4a8bb8` background color

### 2. Component Styling

#### Navigation Bar
- Ocean gradient background with glow effects
- Active nav links have ocean blue highlight with shadow
- Username displays as "Hello, USERNAME!" (non-clickable)
- Profile picture avatar in header (when uploaded)
- Logout button styled with red gradient

#### Post Components
- Posts now feature dark gradient backgrounds with ocean blue accents
- All post text (titles, comments, captions) is white
- Like and comment icons with hover effects
- Profile pictures display in post author avatars
- Comment section toggle via click (hidden by default, show on click)

#### Forms (Login/Register/Create Post)
- Ocean-themed form cards with gradient backgrounds
- White placeholders matching label fonts
- Ocean blue submit buttons with glow effects
- Disabled states use dimmed ocean gradient (not grey)
- All form text is white or ocean blue

### 3. User Experience Improvements

#### Page Protection
- "Sign In Required" walls added to:
  - Create Post page
  - Dorms & Layouts page
  - User Profile page
- Styled consistently with ocean theme
- "Create Post" link hidden from nav when not signed in

#### Navigation
- Auto-scroll to top when navigating between pages
- Browser back button maintains scroll position

#### User Profile
- Centered, narrower profile card
- Avatar with ocean glow effects
- Centered tab navigation ("My Posts" / "Liked Posts")
- Ocean-themed tab styling with active state glow

#### Post Functionality
- Edit posts from user profile
- Delete posts (with confirmation)
- Profile picture upload
- User-specific like persistence (fixed cross-user like bug)

### 4. Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layouts maintained
- Breakpoints at 768px and 480px
- Text scales appropriately on smaller screens

## Technical Changes

### State Management
- Like state now persists user ID (not just boolean)
- Engagement data stored in localStorage with user-specific tracking
- Profile images stored in auth store

### Router
- Added `scrollBehavior` function
- Returns to top on navigation, preserves position on back/forward

### Components Updated
- `src/App.vue` - Navigation bar, logout styling
- `src/views/HomeView.vue` - Hero sections, ocean theme
- `src/views/DormsLayoutsView.vue` - Post styling, filters, comment toggle
- `src/views/UserProfileView.vue` - Profile card, tabs, edit/delete posts
- `src/views/CreatePostView.vue` - Ocean theme, form styling
- `src/components/Login.vue` - Ocean theme, white text
- `src/components/Register.vue` - Ocean theme, white text
- `src/assets/main.css` - Background color, fonts
- `src/assets/base.css` - Font imports

## Design Philosophy
The new design embodies fluidity and transformation through:
- Flow-inspired fonts
- Bioluminescent glow effects
- Ocean color palette
- Smooth transitions and hover states
- Playful, inviting aesthetic
